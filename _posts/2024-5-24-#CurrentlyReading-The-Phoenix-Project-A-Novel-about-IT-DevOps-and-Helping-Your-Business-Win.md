I first brought the paperback edition a few years ago for my business trip. For some reasons I gave it away without finish reading it (I seldom to have patience to finish a whole book). But it was a nice coincidence at the time as I was the PM in my last company working on an idea incurbation platform, our team worked like a startup within an established organization. What happened in the book reminiscent a lot to our project. #CurrentlyReading #Kindle
