Several months ago my 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar has some strange black lines on the top of the display. They would often appear in cold environment, the position of the black lines are not fixed but they tend to be in the very top area near the menu bar.

Recently the problem become worse and they would appear whenever the Mac wake up from sleep. Since the lines are flickering so it is very annoying. It turns out it is a very common problem for 2016 Touch Bar MBP. 

Today I went to Apple Store and book for a Genius Bar appointment, as expected the display is faulty and since my MBP is out of warranty already, the replacement charge for the LCD is HK$3800 (~US$490)! Wow!

There is no way I'd spend that much for the replacement LCD, the problem is annoying but not to the point of unusable. The Genius does recommend me to use an external monitor or switch to Dark Mode. Oh he is really a genius! Turing the whole UI to dark theme really does help to reduce the distraction from the flickering black lines.
