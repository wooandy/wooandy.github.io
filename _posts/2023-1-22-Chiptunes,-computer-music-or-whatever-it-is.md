In replying to [Metin](https://metinseven.artstation.com)'s Mastodon [post](https://mastodon.hk/@metin@mastodon.art/109721998763825688) about his nostalgia of retro computer game music (aka chiptunes):

> I love to wallow in retro computer game chiptune nostalgia. My most intense memories are attached to the chiptunes of our own games, back in the 16-bit years.

I have been trying to collect some YM chiptune files and play with my Arduino-based AY-3-8910 Programmable Sound Generator. My original target was just to play the OutRun arcade music, but I'm happy to find out some Star Wars tunes. :-)
