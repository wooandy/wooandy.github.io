Few days ago was the sixth anniversary of Steve Jobs' passing. He loves [cubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTcube), when he returned to Apple, he did it [again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Mac_G4_Cube). Even though both cubes were a commercial failure but they are a few most admired products in the history. You can find them in museums like [MoMA](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/82134). I love it, but I couldn't afford it, so I [hacked](http://www.mini-itx.com/projects/g4pc/) one, in 2002.
