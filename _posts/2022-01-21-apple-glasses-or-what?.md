[Mark Gurman](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-01-16/what-will-apple-aapl-call-its-new-ar-vr-headset-apple-vision-apple-reality-kyhmibia) is speculating the names of the Apple AR/VR Headset (aka Apple Glasses):

>For an Apple headset, the process may be a little trickier. Obvious names like Glass or Spectacles have already been used by the likes of Google and Snap Inc. (Google Glass was considered a flop, and Snap Spectacles are still a work in progress.) So I think you can rule those out. 

>Here are some possibilities:
>- Apple Vision
>- Apple Reality
>- Apple Sight / iSight
>- Apple Lens / Apple Googles
>- Apple AR, Apple VR, Apple XR, Apple MR or Apple SR

Given the rumored features are focused on gaming, content and comms, I'd bet the name would be called **Apple Pod**, **ViewPod** or simply **Apple Glasses**.
