It is the [30th anniversary](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/05/remembering-apples-newton-30-years-on/) since the launch of the [Newton Original MessagePad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MessagePad) (OMP). I brought mine in 1997 and it was my first Apple computer - back then we called them [Personal Digital Assistants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_digital_assistant) (PDAs) - I was no programmer but I was really interested in the platform I even brought a [book](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Newton-Software-Development-Newtonscript/dp/0124848001) to learn [NewtonScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NewtonScript) development. Mind you, I didn't even have the [Newton Toolkit](http://newtonfaq.com/newton-faq-development.html#VIIA1a) software (separate purchase). So at the end, I never done any development work on Newton.

30 years later, my OMP has since been long dead. But with the magic of [emulators](https://github.com/pguyot/Einstein), I can experience the beauty of NewtonOS and I'm learning NewtonScript [development](http://messagepad.org/Newton_Script_NTK.html) and developing an App from the book.
