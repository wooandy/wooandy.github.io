I love my Beats Pill+, I donâ€™t use it very often but it comes in handy when I want some more volume than my iPhone provides. It was not updated for years so I am not surprised to hear it was [discontinued](https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/10/apple-discontinues-beats-pill-plus/) last week, but I hope there is a [battery-powered](https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/01/16/apple-once-prototyped-homepod-with-battery-power?utm_source=&utm_medium=&utm_campaign=RSS) HomePod.
